# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets:
Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. We're working for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.

At our company, We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use our app â€” the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better.
